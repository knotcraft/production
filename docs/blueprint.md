## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft pink (#EE2B5B) for a romantic and elegant feel.
- Background: Light gray (#F8F6F6) for light mode and dark gray (#221015) for dark mode to ensure readability and contrast.
- Accent color: a slightly bluer pink (#89616B), darker than the primary to ensure a good level of contrast. This accent will be particularly relevant in cases where the app can render text in both a light and dark theme, and the text in either theme needs to stand out clearly against the app's light or dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Plus Jakarta Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable design.
- Use Material Symbols Outlined for a consistent and modern look. Active elements use filled icons.
- Use a mobile-first approach with a max-width container for larger screens. Fixed bottom navigation for easy access to main sections.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects to enhance user interaction and provide feedback.
